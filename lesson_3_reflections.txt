When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for allowing others to view and/or contribute to your project.  It also allows you to work on your project from anywhere, even if you don't have your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually allows you to control what changes you accept into your project, esp if they're submitted by other contibutors.
