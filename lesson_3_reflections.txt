When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for allowing others to view and/or contribute to your project.  It also allows you to work on your project from anywhere, even if you don't have your local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually allows you to control what changes you accept into your project, esp if they're submitted by other contibutors.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a built in tool only used on GitHub.  It allows you to clone another Github repository into your Github repository, with a link back to the original.
Clones can be used either local - local or Github - local to make a copy of a repository.
Branches are used to allow work on a project that doesn't directly affect the master.  It's used to add features, fix bugs, or allow others to contribute.
You'd use a fork when you need to clone from one Github repository to another.
You'd use a clone to make copies between local repositories or between Github and locals.
You'd use a branch to work on logical changes that aren't ready to be included in master yet and also to allow others to work on your project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You want to keep them in sync so when changes are made, less risk of bugs and conflicts.
